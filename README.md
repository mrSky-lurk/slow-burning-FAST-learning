# 🚀 Slow-Burning FAST Learning

Welcome to **slow-burning-FAST-learning** — where we light a fire under your FASTAPI journey, one cautious spark at a time! 🔥🐍

This repo is all about learning FASTAPI (with a dash of PostgreSQL) from scratch. Expect hands-on experiments, inevitable mistakes, and a few "Aha!" moments along the way.

- **Tech Stack:** Python, FASTAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Mission:** Fumble, stumble, and eventually fly with API development!

> Learning FASTAPI at a slow burn—because great APIs (and learners) aren’t built in a day.

**Pull requests, feedback, and friendly corrections welcome!**
